      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am graduated from Texas A&amp;M on May 2017 with a Bachlors of Science in Computer Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was employed over at <a href="http://www.capsher.com"><img src="images/capsher_favicon.ico">CAPSHER Technology</a> as a Part-Time Software Developer for just under 3 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current interests surround Machine Learning and Data Science, but I have a soft spot in my heart for web developement. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On my spare time, if you don't find me playing Rocket League then I am likely still teaching myself how to properly burnish leather or working on the coursework for an Automotive Technology class.

        I've curated a couple of things I've written recently, but feel free to peruse through all of my <a href="https://github.com/dimasgonzales">repositories</a>.

        <h3><a href="https://gist.github.com/dimasgonzales/fd330d327a917580091dcc87ed5b4ed2">kml2SQL.py</a></h3>
        <p>
          kml2SQL.py is a simple script that transform US Census County KMLs into INSERT Statements for MySQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realize there are proper and robust tools that help with the KML to DBMS ingesting, but since I needed the data for a Database Systems course, which covered both SQL and XLM, I figured it would be a good way to review the material.

          This iPython Notebook outlines how I used simple natural language processing techniques and machine learning in order to determine which companies to visit during the Career Fair just by using the company description.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Texas A&M Engineering Career Fair our campus is visited by many organizations looking for the best talent. As much as I would love to spend my entire day talking to all the companies, I only have a small time frame during which I would be able to talk to our visitors. Naturally I would create a short list of which companies I need to ensure I visit with but I wanted to create a tool that would help me narrow my research and maybe even discover new opportunities.

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/dimasgonzales/kindergartenpp">Kindergarten++</a></h3>
        <p>
          K++ is a CMS that consolidates popular classroom activities that educators rely on into a single site to reduce clutter and enable them to create new ways to engage their students. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My girlfriend is a gradeschool teacher and often found herself frustrated looking for activities that she could use in the classroom or with repeative tasks. I took it as a personal challenge to help automate as my of her frutrations away. The result has been K++.
